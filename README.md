Tired of losing your precious XP? üò§ ExpBottle to the rescue! üöÄ This Spigot plugin lets players bottle up their experience to use later or send to friends. All with style, custom messages, and slick MiniMessage formatting! ‚ú®

## üî• Core Features

*   **XP Bottling & Retrieval**: `/exp get [amount|amountL|all]` - Turn XP into tradable bottles.
*   **Direct XP Transfer**: `/exp send <player> <amount|amountL|all>` - Zap XP directly to others!
*   **Bulk Bottling**: `/exp split <amount|amountL>` - Create multiple bottles of a fixed size.
*   **Admin Gifting**: `/exp give <player> <amount|amountL> [count]` - Give bottles to players (works from console too!).
*   **Universal Bottle Use**: Standard experience bottles with stored XP work as expected.
*   **Seamless Interaction**: Use chests, furnaces, etc., normally while holding a custom EXP bottle.
*   **Deep Customization**:
    *   üåç **Full Localization**: Edit `lang/<locale_code>.yml` files (e.g., `en_US.yml`, `ru_RU.yml`). Supports **MiniMessage** for awesome text formatting!
    *   üó£Ô∏è **Smart Localization**: Automatically detects player's language and uses the right translation from `lang/` files.
    *   üîä **Sound Notifications**: Customizable sound alert when receiving XP from another player.
    *   üì¶ **Inventory Management**: Configure behavior for full inventories (`drop` or `error`).
    *   ‚úÇÔ∏è **Splitting Control**: Set min/max levels/XP and steps for `/exp split`.
*   **Permission-Based**: Fine-grained control over who can do what.
*   **Instant Reload**: `/exp reload` - Apply config changes without a server restart.

## üéÆ Commands & Permissions

All commands start with `/exp` (or your configured alias).

**Understanding Amounts:**
*   `100` = 100 experience points.
*   `10L` = 10 experience levels.
*   `all` = All your current experience (not applicable for `/split` or `/give` amount per bottle).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

ExpBottle is highly configurable!

*   **`config.yml`**:
    *   `default_language`: e.g., `en_US`, `ru_RU`.
    *   `command.name` & `command.aliases`: Customize your command.
    *   `bottle_lore`: Define the look of your XP bottles. Use MiniMessage!
        *   Placeholders: `<player>`, `<amount_xp>`, `<full_levels>`, `<amount_lvl>`.
    *   `sound_settings.*`: Configure sounds for different actions (see details below).
    *   `command.get.inventory_full_action`: Action on full inventory (`drop` or `error`).
    *   `command.split.*`: Parameters for the split command (min levels, step, etc.).
    *   _(... and other general settings if any)_

*   **Sound Settings (`sound_settings`) Details**:
    *   `get`:
        *   `enabled: true|false` - Sound when using `/exp get`.
        *   `name: "SOUND_NAME"` - Bukkit sound name (e.g., `ENTITY_ITEM_PICKUP`).
        *   `volume: 1.0`
        *   `pitch: 1.0`
    *   `send_receive`:
        *   `enabled: true|false` - Sound for the recipient of `/exp send` or `/exp give`.
        *   `name: "SOUND_NAME"` (e.g., `ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP`).
        *   `volume: 1.0`
        *   `pitch: 1.0`
    *   `split`:
        *   `enabled: true|false` - Sound when using `/exp split`.
        *   `name: "SOUND_NAME"` (e.g., `BLOCK_AMETHYST_BLOCK_CHIME`).
        *   `volume: 1.0`
        *   `pitch: 1.0`

*   **`lang/` Directory (e.g., `lang/en_US.yml`)**:
    *   All player-facing messages are here! The plugin smartly picks the right file based on each player's client language!
    *   Uses **MiniMessage** for colors, formatting, and hover/click events.
    *   Example MiniMessage: `<green>Success! <yellow><player></yellow> received <blue><amount_xp></blue> XP.</green>`
    *   Placeholders are generally `<placeholder_name>`.
